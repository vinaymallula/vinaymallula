## Hi there 👋 👩‍💻

Hello! I'm Vinay, a fresher and aspiring Machine Learninng Engineer  with a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization and Machine Learning. I recently completed a Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp, where I built several hands-on projects using real-world business scenarios.

I’ve worked extensively with:

Machine Learning for developing predictive models, identifying patterns, and solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches
Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
SQL for querying, joining, and analyzing structured data to support model building and analysis
Power BI for translating insights into interactive dashboards and delivering compelling data stories
Excel for exploratory analysis, pivot reports, and dashboard creation for business use cases

I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that learn from data and turn complex patterns into actionable predictions.
