## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hello! I'm **Vinay**, I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in data analytics, machine learning, and Python programming. I’ve worked on real-world case studies involving hospitality analytics, business recommendations, and predictive modeling — even implementing ML algorithms manually to understand them deeply.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and a Data Science & Machine Learning certification from Scaler. Passionate about solving real-world problems using data and continuously leveling up with tools like SQL, Power BI, and Scikit-learn.

Currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in data-driven roles such as ML Engineer, Data Analyst, or AI Intern.

I've worked extensively with:

- 🤖 **Machine Learning** for developing predictive models, identifying patterns, and solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches  
- 🐍 **Python** for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization using libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  
- 🧠 **SQL** for querying, joining, and analyzing structured data to support model development and business insights  
- 📊 **Power BI** for transforming insights into interactive dashboards and delivering compelling data stories  
- 📈 **Excel** for exploratory analysis, pivot reports, and dashboard creation for business use cases  

I'm passionate about **building intelligent systems that learn from data** and turn complex patterns into actionable predictions.
