## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hello! I'm **Vinay**, a fresher and aspiring **Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong foundation in **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **machine learning**.  
I recently completed a **Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp**, where I built several hands-on projects using real-world business scenarios.

I've worked extensively with:

- 🤖 **Machine Learning** for developing predictive models, identifying patterns, and solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches  
- 🐍 **Python** for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization using libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  
- 🧠 **SQL** for querying, joining, and analyzing structured data to support model development and business insights  
- 📊 **Power BI** for transforming insights into interactive dashboards and delivering compelling data stories  
- 📈 **Excel** for exploratory analysis, pivot reports, and dashboard creation for business use cases  

I'm passionate about **building intelligent systems that learn from data** and turn complex patterns into actionable predictions.
